# Chronic-Kidney-Diseases-Prediction

#### Problem: In Chronic-Kidney-Diseases Dataset we have to predict class wheather the patient is suffering from Chronic disease or not. It is classification based probelm in class feature have two Unique value i.e. "ckd" and "notckd".

##### Steps to be taken while exploring Chronic-Kidney-Diseases Dataset are:
   Perform Data preprocessing and prepare data for analysis.
    
###### Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Analysing distribution of each and every numerical column.
2. Check Label distribution of categorical data
3. Find Relationship between the features
###### Apply Feature Engineering 
1. Data Cleaning Techniques, 
2. Check missing values in categorical features & numerical features, 
3. feature Encoding Technique.
###### Feature Selection
   Select best features for model using suitable Feature Importance Technique.
###### Model Selection
   Build a Cross-Validated Model & predict & check accuracy of the model.
